# Fisher-number-checker

This code is solution of "Fisher Number" challange.

A Fisher number is an integer whose multipliers are
equal to the number's cube. For example, 12 is a Fisher number,
because 12^3 = 2 x 3 x 4 x 6 x 12.

For example:
Input: 12
Output: true (12^3 = 2 x 3 x 4 x 6 x 12)

Input: 8 
Output: false (8^3 != 2 x 4 x 8)

Write a program to check if the user input is a Fisher number
or not.

Bonus: Print all the Fisher numbers in a given range.

For input:
r [ENTER]
1 [ENTER]
50 [SUBMIT]
